I tried the other problems, but they were very hard for me, for some I even couldn't find an approach to solve. I want to request the mentors to provide us resources
regarding them, or tell us how to think about the approaches behind them, like in the first problem, I don't know how to proceed with the information given in the 
problem about the indices of the segment and the bitwise OR of all the elements of the segement, I do not know how to think of a good way to construct the sequence
from the given information in a time efficient way.

For the problem of "Difference of Squares", that was the only question I was able to solve in the first go, and that code I have given in the separate file.

For the problem of "PrimeFactorPrime", I thought of an approach and I wrote the code, but the Time Limit Exceeded on few test cases, I am giving that code below, but 
I do not know how to omptimise it:
// THE CODE FOR PRIMEFACTORPRIME :-
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int count_prime_fact(long long n){
    int res = 0;
    for(long long i = 2; i*i <= n; i++){
        while(n % i == 0){
            n /= i;
            res++;
        }
        if(n == 1) break;
    }
    if(n>1) res++;
    return res;
}

int main(){
    long long l, r;
    cin>>l>>r;
    vector<bool> v(r+1, true);
    v[0] = v[1] = false;
    for(long long i = 2; i*i<=r; i++){
        if(v[i]){
            for(int j = i*i; j<=r; j+=i) v[j] = false;
        }
    }
    long long ans = 0;
    for(long long i = l; i<=r; i++){
        if(v[i]) continue;
        else{
            int count = count_prime_fact(i);
            if(v[count]) ans++;
        }
    }

    cout<<ans;
    return 0;
}
